### 1. RESOLUTION RULES INTERPRETATION
"The question resolves YES if Kristi Noem is no longer serving as the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security by March 31, 2026... It resolves NO if she is still serving in that position on March 31, 2026."
- **YES requires:** A vacancy in the office of the Secretary of Homeland Security formerly held by Kristi Noem, or a new individual (including an Acting Secretary) holding the role.
- **NO if:** Kristi Noem remains the incumbent Secretary (Senate-confirmed).
- **Key distinction:** This is a pure incumbency test. Any reason for departure (firing, resignation, promotion, or death) triggers a YES.
- **Deadline:** March 31, 2026.

### 2. MARKET CALIBRATION
- **Current market price:** 14% (Estimated based on historical "Cabinet Survival" volatility for high-profile roles).
- **Market-implied probability:** Low-to-moderate risk of departure within the first 14 months of a term.
- **If I diverge significantly (>5%), here's why:** My estimate (18%) is slightly higher than a generic "safe" cabinet member because the DHS position is historically the most volatile in a Trump-aligned administration, and March has historically functioned as a "firing month" for Trump (e.g., Tillerson and Shulkin were both removed in March 2018).

### 3. PATHWAY DECOMPOSITION

| # | Pathway | Key Gates (who/what must happen) | Time Feasible? | P(Path) |
|---|---------|----------------------------------|----------------|---------|
| 1 | Fired by President (Performance) | Trump dissatisfaction -> Public criticism -> Request for resignation | ✓ | 10% |
| 2 | Resignation (Scandal/PR) | New scandal/gaffe -> Loss of "loyalty" status -> Forced resignation | ✓ | 5% |
| 3 | Promotion/Lateral Move | Vacancy in CoS or other role -> Trump moves Noem to White House | ✓ | 2% |
| 4 | Voluntary/Health/Other | Personal decision or health emergency | ✓ | 1% |

### 4. GATE ANALYSIS (for top 1-2 pathways)

**Pathway 1: Fired by President (Performance)**
```
P(Path1) = P(Border optics/numbers deteriorate in Feb/Mar) × P(Trump blames Noem personally) × P(Trump acts within the 60-day window)
         = 40% × 50% × 50% 
         = 10%
```
*Rationale: Trump’s history with DHS secretaries (Kelly, Nielsen) shows a pattern of high expectations followed by rapid disillusionment when border metrics do not meet his public rhetoric. March is a high-risk month for "performance-based" shakeups.*

**Pathway 2: Resignation (Scandal/PR)**
```
P(Path2) = P(Resurfacing of past controversies or new PR gaffe) × P(Negative impact on Trump’s image) × P(Decision to part ways)
         = 25% × 40% × 50%
         = 5%
```
*Rationale: Noem has a higher-than-average "gaffe rate" (e.g., the 2024 book controversy), making her a more likely candidate for a "distraction-based" removal than a lower-profile technocratic secretary.*

### 5. PROBABILITY COMPUTATION

| Pathway | Probability |
|---------|-------------|
| Fired (Performance/Optics) | 10% |
| Resignation (Scandal) | 5% |
| Promotion/Lateral Move | 2% |
| Voluntary/Health | 1% |
| **TOTAL P(YES)** | **18%** |

### 6. UPDATE TRIGGERS
1. **Trump criticizes DHS performance on social media** → [+15%] as this is the standard precursor to a firing.
2. **Noem is absent from a high-profile border visit with the President** → [+10%] signaling she is being sidelined.
3. **A "Border Czar" is appointed to the White House with superior authority** → [+7%] reducing her relevance and increasing exit probability.
4. **Noem leads a successful, high-visibility enforcement operation** → [-8%] strengthening her job security.
5. **A major scandal involving Noem’s past or family emerges** → [+12%] providing a "clean" reason for Trump to request a resignation.
