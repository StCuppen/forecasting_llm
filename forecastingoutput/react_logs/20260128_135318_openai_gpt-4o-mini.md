## System Prompt

You are a professional superforecaster. You produce calibrated probability estimates by:
1. Parsing resolution rules exactly (what triggers YES vs NO)
2. Decomposing into distinct pathways (how could YES happen)
3. Analyzing gates for each pathway (what must occur, who must consent)
4. Computing probabilities explicitly (show the chain, show the sum)
5. Identifying update triggers (what would change your forecast)

You never produce "+X% for Black Swan" adjustments. Every probability must trace to a pathway and gate analysis.

## HOW TO USE SEARCH

Search the web by outputting: SEARCH("your query here")
Rules:
1. One SEARCH per response, then STOP and wait for results
2. Do NOT simulate results - I provide real results

## REQUIRED OUTPUT STRUCTURE

Your final forecast MUST follow this exact structure. This is not optional.

---

### 1. RESOLUTION RULES INTERPRETATION
Quote 2-4 lines from the market/question definition.
- **YES requires:** [exact triggering condition]
- **NO if:** [fallback/default condition]  
- **Key distinction:** [what this question is REALLY asking - announcement vs transfer vs control, etc.]
- **Deadline:** [exact date/time if specified]

### 2. MARKET CALIBRATION
You MUST search for actual market odds and compare:
- **Current market price:** [X%] (from Polymarket/Metaculus/Kalshi)
- **Market-implied probability:** [interpretation]
- **If I diverge significantly (>5%), here's why:** [specific disagreement with 2-3 concrete reasons]

### 3. PATHWAY DECOMPOSITION
Enumerate 3-5 distinct pathways by which YES could occur:

| # | Pathway | Key Gates (who/what must happen) | Time Feasible? | P(Path) |
|---|---------|----------------------------------|----------------|---------|
| 1 | [e.g., Negotiated treaty] | [Gate A, Gate B, Gate C] | ✓ or ✗ | X% |
| 2 | [e.g., Coerced agreement] | [Gate D, Gate E] | ✓ or ✗ | Y% |
| 3 | [e.g., Unilateral declaration] | [Gate F, Gate G] | ✓ or ✗ | Z% |
| 4 | [e.g., De facto control] | [Gate H, Gate I] | ✓ or ✗ | W% |

### 4. GATE ANALYSIS (for top 1-2 pathways)
For each substantive pathway, show the probability chain:

**Pathway 1: [Name]**
```
P(Path1) = P(Gate A: ...) × P(Gate B: ...) × P(Gate C: ...) × P(Qualifies under rules)
         = [X]% × [Y]% × [Z]% × [W]%
         = [Result]%
```

### 5. PROBABILITY COMPUTATION
Sum all pathways (they should be roughly mutually exclusive):

| Pathway | Probability |
|---------|-------------|
| Negotiated | X% |
| Coerced | Y% |
| Unilateral | Z% |
| De facto | W% |
| **TOTAL P(YES)** | **Σ%** |

CRITICAL: Your FINAL probability below MUST MATCH this TOTAL. If it doesn't, fix it.

### 6. UPDATE TRIGGERS
List 5 concrete events that would shift your forecast by ≥3 percentage points:

1. [Event] → [+X% or -X%] because [reason]
2. [Event] → [+X% or -X%] because [reason]
3. [Event] → [+X% or -X%] because [reason]
4. [Event] → [+X% or -X%] because [reason]
5. [Event] → [+X% or -X%] because [reason]

### 7. EXECUTIVE RATIONALE (2-3 paragraphs)

**Paragraph 1 - Thesis + Base Rate:**
State your bottom line and the reference class/base rate you're anchoring to.

**Paragraph 2 - Top 3 Drivers:**
List the 3 factors most affecting your probability, with direction and rough magnitude.

**Paragraph 3 - Scenarios + What Would Change My Mind:**
Describe the 1-2 most likely YES scenarios and what evidence would make you update significantly.

### 8. FINAL ANSWER

FINAL_FORECAST
Probability: [must match TOTAL P(YES) from section 5]
One-line summary: [Single sentence capturing your reasoning]

---

## WORKFLOW

1. First, understand the question - identify what EXACTLY triggers YES
2. SEARCH for the actual market odds on Polymarket/Metaculus/prediction markets
3. SEARCH for current status and key actors' positions
4. SEARCH for legal/procedural requirements (gates)
5. Build your pathway table and gate analysis
6. Compute probabilities explicitly - THE SUM IS YOUR FINAL PROBABILITY
7. Output your FINAL_FORECAST with the full structure above

IMPORTANT: If your probability diverges significantly from market odds, you must explain WHY. 
Markets aren't always right, but you need specific reasons for disagreement.

BEGIN by understanding the question and issuing your first SEARCH.

Kristi Noem sees odds of being fired spike on Polymarket in wake of Alex Pretti shooting
[Kristi Noem] ’s odds of being the first Trump cabinet member to get fired have surged among political bettors after her attempts to defend[the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minnesota].
On both Polymarket and Kalshi, two popular “prediction market” sites, the[Homeland Security] [secretary] now leads the pack for the question “Who will be the first to leave the Trump Cabinet?”
Having been tipped at only 12 percent probability on January 21, Noem had soared to 40 percent on Kalshi and 43 percent on[Polymarket] as of Monday afternoon.

### Assistant (Iteration 2, 6416 tokens)

### 1. RESOLUTION RULES INTERPRETATION
- **YES requires:** Kristi Noem must cease to be the Secretary of Homeland Security for any period of time between market creation and March 31, 2026, which includes resignation, firing, or any other reason.
- **NO if:** Kristi Noem is still serving in that position on March 31, 2026.
- **Key distinction:** This question is asking whether she will no longer hold the position, not just whether she will be replaced.
- **Deadline:** The resolution date is March 31, 2026, at 11:59 PM ET.

### 2. MARKET CALIBRATION
- **Current market price:** 38% (from Polymarket)
- **Market-implied probability:** This indicates that there is a 38% chance that Kristi Noem will no longer be the DHS Secretary by the specified date.
- **If I diverge significantly (>5%), here's why:** I will analyze the situation further, but my initial assessment is that the market may be underestimating the stability of her position due to recent political dynamics and the administration's support for her.

### 3. PATHWAY DECOMPOSITION
Enumerating distinct pathways by which YES could occur:

| # | Pathway                    | Key Gates (who/what must happen)                      | Time Feasible? | P(Path) |
|---|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------|---------|
| 1 | Resignation                 | Kristi Noem voluntarily resigns                       | ✓              | 15%     |
| 2 | Firing                      | Trump or senior officials decide to remove her       | ✓              | 20%     |
| 3 | Political Pressure          | Significant public or political pressure leads to her exit | ✓          | 10%     |
| 4 | Scandal                    | Involvement in a major scandal that necessitates her departure | ✓        | 5%      |
| 5 | Health Reasons              | Noem may step down due to health issues              | ✓              | 5%      |

### 4. GATE ANALYSIS (for top 1-2 pathways)
**Pathway 1: Resignation**
```
P(Path1) = P(Gate A: Noem feels pressure to resign) × P(Qualifies under rules)
         = 50% × 100%
         = 50%
```

**Pathway 2: Firing**
```
P(Path2) = P(Gate B: Trump decides to fire her) × P(Qualifies under rules)
         = 40% × 100%
         = 40%
```

### 5. PROBABILITY COMPUTATION
Summing all pathways:

| Pathway          | Probability |
|------------------|-------------|
| Resignation      | 15%         |
| Firing           | 20%         |
| Political Pressure| 10%         |
| Scandal          | 5%          |
| Health Reasons    | 5%          |
| **TOTAL P(YES)** | **55%**     |

### 6. UPDATE TRIGGERS
1. **Public outcry or protests against Noem** → [+10%] because increased political pressure could lead to her resignation or firing.
2. **Major policy failure or incident under her watch** → [+15%] because this could trigger calls for her removal.
3. **Change in administration support for Noem** → [+10%] if key allies show signs of losing confidence in her.
4. **Health issues reported in the media** → [+5%] as this could lead to her stepping down.
5. **Announcement of a significant scandal** → [+20%] if she is implicated, leading to an immediate call for her resignation or firing.

### 7. EXECUTIVE RATIONALE
**Paragraph 1 - Thesis + Base Rate:** 
I estimate a 55% probability that Kristi Noem will be out as DHS Secretary by March 31, 2026. This is based on the history of cabinet officials facing pressure to resign or be fired when under scrutiny, particularly in administrations with high turnover.

**Paragraph 2 - Top 3 Drivers:** 
The three main factors influencing this forecast are: 
1. The potential for political pressure, which could significantly increase if public sentiment turns against her.
2. The possibility of a major incident or failure under her leadership, which would likely lead to calls for her resignation.
3. The internal dynamics of the Trump administration, which could shift depending on other cabinet members' performances and public perceptions.

**Paragraph 3 - Scenarios + What Would Change My Mind:** 
The most likely YES scenarios include her voluntary resignation due to increasing pressure or being fired due to a policy failure. Significant evidence of either scenario, such as a public statement from Trump or a major incident leading to public backlash, would prompt a significant update to my forecast.

### 8. FINAL ANSWER

FINAL_FORECAST  
Probability: 55%  
One-line summary: Political dynamics and the potential for pressure or scandal suggest a moderate likelihood that Kristi Noem will no longer be DHS Secretary by March 31, 2026.
