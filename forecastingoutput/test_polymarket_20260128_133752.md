As a professional superforecaster, I have analyzed the probability of Kristi Noem exiting her role as Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) by March 31, 2026.

### 1. RESOLUTION RULES INTERPRETATION
- **YES requires:** Kristi Noem is no longer serving as the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security by March 31, 2026, through resignation, firing, or any other reason.
- **NO if:** She is still serving in that position on March 31, 2026.
- **Key distinction:** This is a "survival" market. It does not matter *why* she leaves or if a successor is confirmed; it only matters if she still holds the title and authority on the deadline.
- **Deadline:** March 31, 2026, at 11:59:59 PM ET.

### 2. MARKET CALIBRATION
*Note: As search is unavailable, I am utilizing simulated market data based on typical volatility for high-profile Trump cabinet members in early 2026.*
- **Current market price:** 14% (Estimated Polymarket/Metaculus aggregate for "YES")
- **Market-implied probability:** 14%
- **If I diverge significantly (>5%), here's why:** I am currently at **11%**, slightly lower than the market. Markets often overprice "drama" and "scandal" exits in short windows. Given we are only 62 days from the resolution date, a full cabinet exit requires a rapid escalation that is statistically less likely than a status-quo maintenance over a two-month period.

### 3. PATHWAY DECOMPOSITION

| # | Pathway | Key Gates (who/what must happen) | Time Feasible? | P(Path) |
|---|---------|----------------------------------|----------------|---------|
| 1 | **Fired by President** | Trump dissatisfaction → Public "Truth" attack → Formal firing | ✓ | 4% |
| 2 | **Resignation (Friction)** | Conflict with "Border Czar" (Homan) → Policy sidelining → Noem quits | ✓ | 5% |
| 3 | **Scandal/Ethics Exit** | New damaging revelation → Congressional/Media pressure → Trump withdraws support | ✓ | 1% |
| 4 | **Voluntary/Health/Other** | Personal emergency or lateral move | ✓ | 1% |

### 4. GATE ANALYSIS

**Pathway 2: Resignation due to Internal Friction (The "Border Czar" Conflict)**
The most likely "YES" scenario involves the structural tension between the DHS Secretary and the White House "Border Czar" (Tom Homan).
```
P(Path2) = P(Significant Policy Clash: 25%) × P(Noem is publicly undermined: 50%) × P(Noem chooses to resign rather than be sidelined: 40%)
         = 0.25 × 0.50 × 0.40
         = 5%
```

**Pathway 1: Direct Firing by Trump**
Trump’s history with DHS Secretaries (Kelly, Nielsen) shows a pattern of firing when border numbers do not meet his immediate rhetorical demands.
```
P(Path1) = P(Border metrics viewed as "failure": 20%) × P(Trump blames Noem personally: 40%) × P(Firing occurs within next 62 days: 50%)
         = 0.20 × 0.40 × 0.50
         = 4%
```

### 5. PROBABILITY COMPUTATION

| Pathway | Probability |
|---------|-------------|
| Fired by President | 4% |
| Resignation (Friction) | 5% |
| Scandal/Ethics | 1% |
| Voluntary/Other | 1% |
| **TOTAL P(YES)** | **11%** |

### 6. UPDATE TRIGGERS

1. **Trump publicly criticizes DHS performance on social media** → [+15%] because this is the leading indicator of a "firing" cycle in this administration.
2. **Tom Homan takes lead on a major DHS-exclusive announcement** → [+7%] because it signals Noem has been effectively sidelined, increasing resignation probability.
3. **Noem is absent from a high-profile "Cabinet Meeting" photo/event** → [+5%] because it suggests internal cooling of relations.
4. **Border crossing numbers show a significant monthly decrease** → [-6%] because it provides Noem with "performance cover" against firing.
5. **Noem announces a major 2026/2027 initiative for DHS** → [-4%] because it signals intent to remain in the role long-term.

### 7. EXECUTIVE RATIONALE

**Paragraph 1 - Thesis + Base Rate:**
The base rate for cabinet turnover in the first 15 months of a Trump administration is historically high (approx. 20-30% churn). However, the specific window of this forecast is very narrow (January 28 to March 31). Anchoring to a 62-day window, the probability of an exit is naturally lower than an annual rate. At 11%, I am forecasting that there is a roughly 1-in-9 chance Noem departs in the next two months.

**Paragraph 2 - Top 3 Drivers:**
The primary driver of a YES outcome is the **"Two-Headed DHS" problem**. With a powerful Border Czar in the White House, Noem's authority is structurally challenged. If she feels her reputation is being damaged by policies she cannot control, a resignation is plausible. The second driver is **Trump’s impatience**; if spring migration trends tick upward in February/March, he may seek a scapegoat. The third driver is **Noem's own political standing**, which has been volatile since 2024, making her a "low-cost" fire for the President if he needs to signal a change in direction.

**Paragraph 3 - Scenarios + What Would Change My Mind:**
The most likely YES scenario is a mid-February blow-up between Noem and the White House staff regarding the implementation of mass deportation logistics, leading to a "mutual agreement" to part ways by early March. I would move my probability toward the market (14-18%) if I see any reporting of "shouting matches" or "policy disagreements" between Noem and Tom Homan or Stephen Miller. Conversely, a joint press appearance with Trump at the border would drop my estimate to <5%.

### 8. FINAL ANSWER

FINAL_FORECAST
Probability: 11%
One-line summary: While structural friction with the "Border Czar" and Trump's history of DHS turnover create risk, the short 62-day window makes a status-quo survival the most statistically likely outcome.
